# matching_socks.
match ID's , socks, etc.
When running the code the script will pair a random amount of socks to their pairs.
This code started with a version that ran only in terminal and changes step by step to a GUI. 
Actual = V 0.5.
for version 0.2 the code will generate the GUI for it.
25/03/2020 - 01/04/2020
for verison 0.3 the code already has the GUI and displays socks.
01/04/2020 - 02/04/2020
for version 0.4 the code will display the button to pull socks and sort them.
02/04/2020 - 04/04/2020
for version 0.5 the code will match the socks and fix some bugs.
04/04/2020 - 
for version 0.6 I will optimize the code by elminating the terminal option and starting a OOP
